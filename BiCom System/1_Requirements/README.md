# Introduction:
Two-way communication is used in the Bicom system. The receiver performs two-way encryption and verification when the driver carries the smart card key and comes within the designated range. The door will automatically open after verification is completed, and the driver will only need to touch the ignition button to start the vehicle. The entire procedure does not necessitate any key operations. It will also provide the motorist with a new level of safety and comfort.The LF downlink in two-way RF systems is solely used to wake up the key fob and establish the RF up/downlink. During the authentication procedure, the bi-directional RF link handles all communication.

# Research:
The Bicom system is referred regarded as 'Passive' because it does not need the user to take any action. A magnetically coupled radio frequency signal is used to communicate between the key and the automobile. When the key is 'in the car's communication range,' the system believes that it is in close proximity. The system is made up of two parts: a key fob and a vehicle module, both of which contain wireless transceivers that use a magnetically coupled radio frequency signal to detect each other. When the key fob is within range, the vehicle's module sends out encoded messages all the time.
